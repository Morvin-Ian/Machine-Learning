## Quick Start

### 1. Understanding Data Types

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Numerical data: Can be used directly in calculations
numerical_data = [1200, 1500, 1800, 2200, 2500]  # Square feet

# Categorical data: Must be encoded
categorical_data = ['Red', 'Blue', 'Green', 'Red', 'Blue']  # Colors
```

### 2. Encoding Categorical Data

```python
# One-hot encoding for nominal data (no order)
colors_encoded = pd.get_dummies(categorical_data)

# Label encoding for ordinal data (has order)
education_mapping = {'High School': 0, 'Bachelor': 1, 'Master': 2, 'PhD': 3}
```

### 3. Scaling Numerical Data

```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

# Standardization (most common)
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test)
```

### 4. Splitting Data

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Basic split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42
)

# Stratified split (for classification)
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    X, y, test_size=0.2, stratify=y, random_state=42
)
```

### 5. Diagnosing Model Problems

```python
# Train and evaluate
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
train_score = model.score(X_train, y_train)
test_score = model.score(X_test, y_test)

# Diagnose
if train_score < 0.7 and test_score < 0.7:
    print("Underfitting: Model too simple")
elif train_score > 0.95 and test_score < 0.7:
    print("Overfitting: Model too complex")
else:
    print("Good fit!")
```

## Key Concepts at a Glance

### Data Types

| Type | Subtypes | Examples | Encoding |
|------|----------|----------|----------|
| **Numerical** | Continuous | Height, price, temperature | Scale (standardize/normalize) |
| | Discrete | Count, age in years | Scale (standardize/normalize) |
| **Categorical** | Nominal | Colors, countries | One-hot or target encoding |
| | Ordinal | Education level, ratings | Label encoding |

### Model Problems

| Problem | Train Error | Test Error | Gap | Solution |
|---------|-------------|------------|-----|----------|
| **Underfitting** | High | High | Small | Increase complexity |
| **Overfitting** | Low | High | Large | Regularization, more data |
| **Good Fit** | Low | Low | Small | Deploy! ✓ |

### Encoding Methods

| Method | Use For | Pros | Cons |
|--------|---------|------|------|
| **Label Encoding** | Ordinal data | Simple, preserves order | Creates false ordering for nominal data |
| **One-Hot Encoding** | Nominal data (low cardinality) | No false ordering | High dimensionality |
| **Target Encoding** | High-cardinality nominal data | Handles many categories | Overfitting risk |

### Scaling Methods

| Method | Formula | Range | Use When |
|--------|---------|-------|----------|
| **Normalization** | $(x - x_{min}) / (x_{max} - x_{min})$ | [0, 1] | Need bounded values |
| **Standardization** | $(x - \mu) / \sigma$ | Unbounded | Data has outliers (most common) |

## Practical Examples

All examples use real code that you can run:

```python
# Complete example: Preparing data for machine learning
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler, OneHotEncoder
from sklearn.compose import ColumnTransformer
from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

# Load data
df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')

# Separate features and target
X = df.drop('target', axis=1)
y = df['target']

# Identify column types
numerical_cols = X.select_dtypes(include=['int64', 'float64']).columns
categorical_cols = X.select_dtypes(include=['object']).columns

# Split data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42
)

# Create preprocessing pipeline
preprocessor = ColumnTransformer(
    transformers=[
        ('num', StandardScaler(), numerical_cols),
        ('cat', OneHotEncoder(drop='first'), categorical_cols)
    ])

# Create complete pipeline
pipeline = Pipeline([
    ('preprocessor', preprocessor),
    ('model', LogisticRegression())
])

# Train and evaluate
pipeline.fit(X_train, y_train)
print(f"Train score: {pipeline.score(X_train, y_train):.3f}")
print(f"Test score: {pipeline.score(X_test, y_test):.3f}")
```

## Common Questions

**Q: Should I always standardize my data?**  
A: For most algorithms (linear models, neural networks, SVM), yes. Tree-based models (decision trees, random forests) don't require scaling.

**Q: When should I use one-hot encoding vs label encoding?**  
A: Use one-hot for nominal data (no order), label encoding for ordinal data (has order).

**Q: How do I know if my model is overfitting?**  
A: Check if training accuracy is much higher than test accuracy (gap > 10%).

**Q: What's the difference between validation and test sets?**  
A: Validation set is for tuning hyperparameters (use multiple times). Test set is for final evaluation (use only once).

**Q: How much data should I use for testing?**  
A: Typically 20% for test set. For small datasets (<1000 samples), use 30%. For large datasets (>100k), 10% is sufficient.

**Q: What is data leakage?**  
A: When information from the test set "leaks" into training, giving unrealistic performance estimates. Always split data before preprocessing!
