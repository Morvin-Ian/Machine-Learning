**Real World ML — Overview**

This folder covers practical topics for taking machine learning from experiments into production. It contains three focused guides:

- `production.md` — how to design, ship, and operate ML systems in production.
- `automated-ml.md` — what AutoML does, how it works, and when to use it.
- `fairness.md` — simple explanations of fairness, common metrics, and mitigation techniques.

Read the individual files for concise, actionable advice and checklists.
